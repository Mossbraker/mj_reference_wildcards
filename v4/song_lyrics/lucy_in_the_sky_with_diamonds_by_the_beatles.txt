a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalad
a bridge by a fountain where rocking horse people e
a train in a station with plasticine porters with l
cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering ove
climb in the back with your head in the clouds and 
everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers that 
look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and shes
lucy in the sky with diamonds
newspaper taxis appear on the shore waiting to take
suddenly someone is there at the turnstile the girl
the beatles
