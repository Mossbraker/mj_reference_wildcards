a woozy youth dopes up on her silky smooth perfume
glass animals
gooey
hold my hand and float back to the summertime
i take your gloom i curl it up and puff it into plu
id say i told you so but you just gonna cry you jus
mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
tangled in the willows now our tongues are tied
the jungle slang spinning round my head and i stare
tripping around the tree stumps in your summer smil
wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
