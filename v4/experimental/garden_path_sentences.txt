mary gave the child the dog bit a band-aid
the complex houses married and single soldiers and 
the cotton clothing is made of grows in mississippi
the horse raced past the barn fell
the man who hunts ducks out on weekends
the raft floated down the river sank
we painted the wall with cracks
when fred eats food gets thrown
