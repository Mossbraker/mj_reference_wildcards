## Stable Diffusion Dynamic Prompts Wildcards from MidJourney Styles and Keywords Reference

Scraped the v4 .md files from the excellent [MidJourney Styles and Keywords Reference](https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference) visual guide and created a hierarchy of wildcard files for use in the [Dynamic Prompts extension](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts) for Stable Diffusion. 

I haven't tested them all out, so I can't guarantee Stable Diffusion will be familiar with all of the styles, keywords, and concepts listed in the files but there should be plenty of fun stuff to play around with.
